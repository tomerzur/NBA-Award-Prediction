# NBA-Award-Prediction
I am predicting the winners of each of the five major individual NBA awards (Most Valuable Player, Defensive Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year, Most Improved Player, and Sixth Man of the Year) using machine learning.

You can view all of the steps I took to create my models at this project's Github pages website: https://tomerzur.github.io/NBA-Award-Prediction/.

You can also view the individual notebooks in this github repo to see the code I wrote for each task I had to complete for this project.

In order to run this project, you will need to download the rbo library from https://pypi.org/project/rbo/. If you want to re-scrape the data yourself, you will also need to download the firefox geckodriver from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
